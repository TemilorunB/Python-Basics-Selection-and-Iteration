--Exercise 1
--Declare a variable my_boolean and assign it the boolean value of true. Print the variable.

my_boolean = True
print(my_boolean)

--Exercise 2
--Declare a variable my_int and assign it the integer value of 3. Print the variable.
--Your program should declare the variable my_int, assign it the value of 3, and then print the variable.

my_int = 3
print(my_int)

--Exercise 3
--Declare a variable my_string and assign it the string value of:

--This is a string
--You need to create the variable my_string, assign it the value of This is a string, and then print the variable.

my_string = "This is a string"
print(my_string)

--Exercise 4
--Declare a variable my_float and assign it the floating point value of 3.0. Print the variable.

Your program should declare the variable my_float, assign it the value of 3.0, and then print the variable.

my_float = 3.0
print(my_float)

--Exercise 5
--Use two print statements to write the following string:

--Okay, it is time to learn about operators.

--There are several ways to solve this problem, so there is no single solution. The key to this problem is removing the newline character from the first print statement. 
--This will ensure that two print statements will produce a single line of output. Here is one possible solution.

print("Okay, ", end='')
print("it is time to learn about operators.")
