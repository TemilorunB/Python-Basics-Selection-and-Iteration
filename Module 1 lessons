Variables are used to store a value, and these values have a data type. Data types describe the kind of information that is being stored. 
Numbers are different than text, and integers are different from numbers with decimals. Variable declaration is when you create a variable and assign it a value. Enter the name of the variable you want to create, a = (called the assignment operator), and the value you want to store in the variable. You do not have to indicate the data type when declaring a variable. Use the print statement to see the value of the variable.

my_variable = "Hello world"
print(my_variable)

note: Do not use quotation marks when printing a variable. Using quotation marks will print the variable name, not its value.
my_variable = "Hello world"
print(my_variable)
print("my_variable")

my_variable = "Hello world"
print(my_variable)
my_variable = "Goodbye world"
print(my_variable)

Strings
A string is a collection of text, numbers, or symbols. Strings are always surrounded by quotation marks.
string_variable = "This is a string"
second_string = 'This is a string also'
print(string_variable)
print(second_string)


Boolean values mean True or False. You will see how boolean values are used when we talk about conditionals and while loops.
boolean_variable = True
print(boolean_variable)

Integers
Integers (often called ints) are whole numbers. They can be positive or negative. Do not use a comma when typing large numbers
5 vs. '5'
integer_variable = 50
print(integer_variable)

Floating point numbers (often called floats) are numbers with a decimal. They can be positive or negative.
float_variable = 50.0
print(float_variable)
